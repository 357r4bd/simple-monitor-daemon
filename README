I need to blow the dust off of this thing; originally created to implement
a hurricane forecasting system at LSU.

This "daemon" runs as a background process and watches a particular spool
directory for files.

The contents of these files are used to direct the actions and parameters
used for these actions by the daemon. A utility script written in Perl is
utilized to get the parameters out of the spool file.
